This project will demonstrate whether Netflics videos' duration are reduced overtime.

Objectives :

1. To check if movie times are reducing.
2. To draw a conclusion


STEPS:

-- import pandas and convert the netflix_csv file to pandas table.
-- select the movie_year, genre, title, and duration, these are the columns we will need for this project.
-- assign colors to each movie genre for distinction purposes
-- plot a scatter plot for visualization
-- Draw our conclution



LET'S GET STARTED!!!!!!!

The conclusion here is: Movie durations are not reducing overtime. We have years in which they're slightly down and years in which they are high.

A proof of this is that a movie in 2018 was about 300 mins which is the highest ever, movies from 1940 - 1950 were less than 100 minutes.


Thank your for going through my project
